There are two types of documents in Lunacy: local and cloud.

* **Local documents** live on your computer. You can access and work with them even when you're offline.
* **Cloud documents** are stored on Icons8 servers. You can access and work with them from any computer that has Lunacy installed and is connected to the internet.

Other advantages of using cloud documents include:

* **Collaboration and file sharing**. You can collaborate with other designers over the same project in real time or demonstrate your work to customers. Also, in the [observer mode](#observer-mode), you can watch what other users are currently doing.
* **Version history**. Local files don't have it.
* You can always **save them as local documents**.  

## Creating a cloud document

To create a new cloud document, do one of the following things:

* In the menu bar, click **File** > **New Cloud Document**.
* Use the `Ctrl+Shift+N` (`⌘ Shift N`) shortcut.
* On the **Home** tab, click **New Cloud Document** (see the figure below).

## Opening a cloud document

To open a cloud document:

1. Go to the **Home** tab.
2. In the **Recent** or **Documents** section, find your document and click it.

## Sharing a cloud document

You can share cloud documents as public or private:

* **Public** documents are accessible to everyone with a common link.
* **Private** documents are accessible through private one-time links only. So, you've got to generate a personal link for every user that you want to invite to your document.

To share a cloud document:

1. In the upper-right corner of the canvas, click **Share**.
2. In the displayed panel, select the type of the document: *public* or *private*.
3. In **Anyone with the link**, select what other users can do with the document:
    * **Edit** — full access to the document (except for deletion).
    * **Export** — users with this access level cannot edit documents. They can only view and export selected objects or the whole project, and inspect the code of the objects. For instance, you can grant export access to developers.
    * **View** — users with this access level can only view the content of the document.
4. Click **Copy link** and send it to the person you want to share the document with.

When invited users click over a shared link and access your document, their avatars show up in the **Share** panel. You can individually modify their access level, temporarily ban or delete them from the list. Personal settings override the **Anyone with the link** setting.

## [Observer mode](#observer-mode)
The Observer Mode enables you to follow the activities of other users on the canvas. For this, click the user's avatar in the top-right corner. You will see a colored frame around the canvas indicating that you're now in the Observer Mode.

To exit the mode, click the user's avatar once again.

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> You will only be able to view the user's activities on the canvas. You won't be able to see the interactions on the side panels.</p>

## Version history

Lunacy automatically saves document versions after a series of 100 user actions. You can also save versions manually through **File > Save to version history** or using the `Ctrl(⌘) + Alt + S` shortcut.

There several ways to view a document version history:

* With the open document, go to **File** > **Show version history**.
* With the open document, right-click over the document tab on the top panel, then select **Show version history** on the context menu.
* On the **Home** tab, right-click over the document card, then select **Show version history** on the context menu. 

The list of versions opens in the right panel. Hover the cursor over the required version and click ![open version button](public/external_link.png) to open it. File versions open as local temporary files that you can save to any folder on your computer and then import back to the Cloud.

Also, on the history panel, you can:

* Sort out versions by clicking the **All**, **Auto**, and **Manual** buttons at the top of the panel.
* Rename, open, copy links to, or delete versions using the respective commands in the context menu (see the figure below). To see the context menu, right-click over the required version.

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Free users can access up to 30 days of version history. To unlock the full history of any existing cloud file, subscribe to a Personal Cloud plan.</p>
